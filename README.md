# redsoft

The test application is implemented with the usage of Spring Boot technology, with provisions made for enhancing it to be a standard Spring Web application/microservice.

To get the result, we can:

1. Run the built executable jar in a standard way, like: java -jar redsoft-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar;

2. Run RedsoftApplicationTests unit test.

Probably, a possible enhancement could be to clarify sorting logics for the case when two countries have the same standard VAT, for example, Croatia and Sweden in our case.
